# Bilevel Optimization with Policy Gradients

This repository implements a bilevel optimization framework for continuous control tasks using policy gradient methods.

## Features

- Two-level optimization structure (upper and lower level)
- Policy gradient implementation with PPO for the lower level
- Gradient coupling between levels
- Trajectory-based gradient estimation
- Modular and extensible architecture

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bilevel-optimization.git
cd bilevel-optimization
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Current Status
This code is currently in the hyperparameter optimization phase.
